      <p>Tufts GNU/Linux User Group aims to enable students to explore the world of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in both a professional and hobbyist capacity. </p>

<p>FOSS software, in particular the Linux operating system family, is growing in popularity and becoming a larger part of everyday life. Furthermore, shifts in software development software have encouraged growth in open source computing. </p>

<p>We invite you to join us in while we learn how to optimize our projects, careers, and lives while giving back to the worldwide community of GNU software users. We will teach how to administer servers, streamline development work, secured digital systems and much much more. </p>
